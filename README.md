# git-repo

A gradle plugin that facilitates using a git repository as your maven repo, useful when you want to host private, internal maven artifacts, but a full blown repository manager is more than you nee.

# Usage

## Creating a repo

Create a git repo to house your artifacts.  If you'd like, the snapshots and releases repositories can be different, or they can be subdirectories of the same repo.

You are welcome to use your git repository's built in access controls, but note that the git-repo plugin only works with ssh urls.

*Note*: git-repo won't work with private repos until Gradle [pull request 386](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/pull/386) is merged.

## Deploying

Add the plugin as a `buildscript` dependency, then apply the plugin.

```groovy
buildscript {
	repositories {
		mavenCentral()
	}
	dependencies {
		classpath 'com.ryanharter.gradle-git-repo:gradle-plugin:1.0.1'
	}
}

apply plugin: 'git-repo'
```

Then you simply configure the maven `uploadArchives` as you normally would, but provide a git url for the repositories.

```groovy
uploadArchives {
	repositories {
		mavenDeployer {
			repository(url: 'git@github.com:rharter/maven-repo.git/releases')
			snapshotRepository(url: 'git@github.com/rharter/maven-repo.git/snapshots')

            // standard pom settings
		}
	}
}
```

Now when you run `./gradlew uploadArchives` your artifacts will be added to your git repository and pushed.

## Consuming

In the project in which you want to consume archives from your github repo, simply add the repo as a repository in your dependencies section.

```groovy
dependencies {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rharter/maven-repo/master/releases" }
        maven { url "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rharter/maven-repo/master/snapshots" }

        // from private repo
        maven {
            url "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owner/reponame/master/releases"
            credentials {
                username GIT_USERNAME
                password GIT_PASSWORD
            }
            authentication {
                basic(BasicAuthentication)
            }
        }
    }
    ...
}
```

## Customizing

### Gradle Repo Directory

By default, gradle-git-repo will clone repositories into `~/.git-repo`.  This can be changed using the `GIT_REPO_CLONE_DIR` environment variable.
